Targeted Engagement for Senior Customers:

Since senior customers exhibit a higher churn rate (38.46%), targeted retention efforts such as personalized offers or better support could help reduce churn in this demographic.

Customers with lower product usage are more likely to churn. By implementing usage-based interventions (e.g., tutorials, usage incentives), businesses can boost engagement and reduce churn.
Revenue at Risk Mitigation:

The $55,731 potential revenue at risk represents customers on the verge of churning. Implementing proactive outreach strategies (e.g., personalized email campaigns) can help re-engage these customers.
Churn Predictive Modeling:

Enhancing the dashboard with machine learning models to predict churn probability could help identify at-risk customers even earlier, allowing businesses to take preventive actions.
Custom Retention Offers:

Offering discounts or subscription upgrades to customers with higher churn likelihood could be a strategic move to retain them.
